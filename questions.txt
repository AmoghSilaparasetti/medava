1. Is it mandatory for the main method to be a static method?
2. In what scenarios is reflection useful? Based on the code so far, the code that uses reflection is lengthy.
3. Is it possible for method to determine which class or function called it in Java?
4. Are there any other interesting / useful features in Java? 
5. Is there anything that Java excels at compared to other languages?

These are the questions I could come up with. I even feel like some of them are easy to answer as well...
